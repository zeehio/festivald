# This is the configuration file for festivald.
# It should be sourced before starting festivald.

## The festival library to use:
#FESTIVALD_LIBDIR=@datadir@/festival

## The heap size. You may need to increase it if you use a very large voice
#FESTIVALD_HEAP_SIZE=10000000

## Whether or not festivald will be initialized
#FESTIVALD_LOAD_INIT=1

## Maximum number of clients to accept:
#FESTIVALD_MAX_CLIENTS=10

## Path to the festivald.socket.
## When the socket is created by systemd (systemd socket activation), it is ignored.
## Otherwise festivald will create the socket here (the directory should exist
## and have thought restricted permissions, as it leaves an open shell to anyone
## with access to the socket).
## Note that the default value may be accessible by too many users...
#FESTIVALD_SOCKET_PATH="@runstatedir@/festivald.socket"
